The LEAF toolbox dictionaries for S2 used in correct input bands causing wrong retrievals and QC codes.
The correct bands were put in code that creates dictionaries: dictionaries-SL2P and dictionaries-SL2P-CCRS
SL2P mainline code now calls these to create dictionaries to allow for control.
This has been fixed in all code base versions.
